# SciVL

The Scientific Visualization Library to make educational animations using 
OpenGL and SDL. The hope it to be able to make simple and intuitive animations
to better explain physics, math, and programming concepts.

To build, you will need the following dependencies:

* OpenGL
* glm
* SDL2
* Freetype2
* Microsoft TTF fonts (Arial--assumed to be in /usr/share/fonts/TTF/arial.ttf)

I will bundle the fonts in the near future to make building easier

This project began as a project for Hack-A-Thingie 2017 at the Okinawa 
Institute of Science and Technology
